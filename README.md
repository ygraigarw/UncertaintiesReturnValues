# UncertaintiesReturnValues

Estimation of return values in the presence of uncertain extreme value model parameters.

Content supports the publication "Uncertainties in return values from extreme value analysis using the generalised Pareto (GP) distribution" by Jonathan, Randell, Wadsworth and Tawn (2020).

# Code files

RunSimulation = main simulation code

gpfitPWM = PWM fit

gpfitMOM = MOM fit

gpfitEB = EB fit (Zhang 2010)

AnnCdf2 = distribution of annual maximum

AnnExcPrb = annual exceedance probability

RtrVal = return value

pLgn = nice legends for plots

pGI = nice png plots

pDflBig = nice font size

pAxsLmt = nice axis limits

# Figure files

Figure files provide supporting evidence for the discussion in Section 7 of paper, where different estimation schemes for GP model are considered.
